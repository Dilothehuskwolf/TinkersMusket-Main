A firearm-themed expansion mod for Tinkers' Construct.

This mod introduces modular gunpowder-based weapons, aiming to replicate the familiar mechanics of Tinkers' Construct while implementing new ideas based on existing mods such as Tinkers Ingenuity and Tinkers-Thinking.

Key goals:

Preserve Tinkers' modular design philosophy

Implement explosive burst fire weapons with high damage and risk factors

Integrate new material attributes and modifiers

Designed for Minecraft Forge 1.20.x and actively referencing open-source modding best practices.
